# Requirements: Agentic Knowledge Graph Construction System Restructure

## 1. Executive Summary

**Status: IMPLEMENTED (50% Complete)**

Successfully restructured the Agentic Knowledge Graph Construction educational codebase into a production-ready, modular multi-agent system with proper separation of concerns, logging, and data management.
