## Usage Examples

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r src/requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
export NEO4J_URI="bolt://localhost:7687"
export NEO4J_USERNAME="neo4j"
export NEO4J_PASSWORD="password"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Run system status check
python src/main.py status

# Start interactive session
python src/main.py interactive

# Process data in batch
python src/main.py batch data/input data/output
```

### Configuration Example
```yaml
agents:
  user_intent:
    enabled: true
    model: "openai/gpt-4o"
    max_retries: 3

neo4j:
  uri: "bolt://localhost:7687"
  username: "neo4j"
  password: "password"

logging:
  level: "INFO"
  log_dir: "./log"
```

## Architecture Benefits

### 🎯 Separation of Concerns
- **Agents**: Focus on specific domain tasks
- **Core**: System-wide functionality
- **Tools**: Reusable operations
- **Utils**: Common utilities

### 📊 Observability
- **Structured Logging**: Machine-readable logs with full context
- **Health Monitoring**: Per-component health checks
- **Performance Metrics**: Timing and resource usage tracking

### 🔧 Maintainability
- **Modular Design**: Independent, testable components
- **Configuration-Driven**: Behavior modification without code changes
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints for better IDE support and error prevention

### 🚀 Scalability
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking agent operations
- **Session Management**: Multiple concurrent user sessions
- **Batch Processing**: Efficient handling of large datasets

## Quality Improvements

### Before (Educational Notebooks)
- ❌ Scattered across multiple lesson directories
- ❌ Hardcoded configurations
- ❌ Limited error handling
- ❌ No centralized logging
- ❌ Difficult to extend or modify

### After (Production-Ready System)
- ✅ Organized, modular codebase
- ✅ Environment-based configuration
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- ✅ Structured logging with full observability
- ✅ Extensible architecture for new features

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for the implementation phase where the remaining agents will be completed, full integration testing will be performed, and the system will be validated against the original educational use cases while providing a robust foundation for production deployment.
